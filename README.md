# MusicWord

This is a React Native project designed to help children learn to read music notation in a fun way. 

As a music teacher of 10 years, I always found that this hangman'esqe game built around music notes, was a hit! I'm passionate about music and I'm passionate about
web development so this is my attempt to marry the two.

This code is a baby so there's more to come soon!

Todos: 

// condense the code by not having the notes hard coded in, but by using an object {key: "note name", value: "cy position"} to draw the <Svg><Circle/><Svg> (note) in the right position based on each letter of the random word pulled. 

// create home page with music option, sfx option, and separate modes. 

// create a scoring system which will trigger different themes upon achievements

// deploy to ios app store
