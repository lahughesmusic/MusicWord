# MusicWord

This is a React Native project designed to help the young uns' learn to read music notation in a fun way. 

As a music teacher of 10 years, I always found that this hangman'esqe game built around music notes, was a hit! I'm passionate about music and I'm passionate about
web development so this is my attempt to marry the two.

This code is a baby so, more to come soon.
